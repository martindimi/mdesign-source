I designed this bussines card, for a friend's souvenirs shop which is named "Rose". The shop is located on a little greek island named Simi!

For this design i was inspired by the original hand drawn sign that the shop uses for quite some years. Therefore i wanted to resemble some of the original artwork elements like the logo and the roses. And this is the final result.

The font used for the text is **Magnolia Script** for which you can find more about [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/41177187/Magnolia-Script-FREE-FONT){:target="_blank"}.

Also some **Font Awesome** icons are used for this project, where you can find more about [here](https://fontawesome.com/license/free){:target="_blank"}.
